	Scenario Outline: As a user, I want to be able to see the news
		When <userRole> logs in with email '<teacherEmail>' and password '<teacherPassword>'
		And <userRole> performs first login actions: data protection acceptance
		When <userRole> creates news with title '<newsTitle>', content '<newsContent>' and current date
		And <userRole> logs out
		And student logs in with email '<studentUsername>' and password '<studentPassword>'
		And student performs first login actions: data protection acceptance, password change '<newStudentPassword>'
		And <userRole> clicks left navigation item 'news'
		Then <userRole> should see that news with title '<newsTitle>' is visible on the list
