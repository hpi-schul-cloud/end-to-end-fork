Feature: Different options for news. I would like to test whether users with different permissions can see my news
    Background: I am logged in as a teacher and I create some news
        Given teacher arrives on the Schul-Cloud homepage
        

    @newsIsVisible
    Scenario Outline: User can see the news
        Given teacher logs in with email '<teacherEmail>' and password '<teacherPassword>'
        Given teacher performs first login actions: data protection acceptance
        When teacher creates some news which has to be published immediately
        And teacher logs out
        And student logs in with email '<studentUsername>' and password '<studentPassword>'
        And student performs first login actions: data protection acceptance, password change '<newStudentPassword>'
        And click left navigation item "news"
        Then teacher can see the news
